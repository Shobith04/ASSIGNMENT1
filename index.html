        <h2 class="fs-800">My Work</h2>
        <p>In my final year project, I developed a wearable sports bra designed to reduce injuries using machine learning. This innovative piece of wearable technology monitors biomechanical data in real-time, providing valuable insights to athletes and fitness enthusiasts.</p>
        <p>The sports bra integrates advanced sensors to track movements and detect patterns that may lead to injuries. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, it analyzes the data to offer personalized feedback and recommendations, helping users improve their form and prevent common injuries.</p>
        <p>This project combines my passion for technology and health, showcasing the potential of wearable devices in enhancing athletic performance and safety. The sports bra not only tracks vital metrics but also learns from the user's activities, adapting to provide more accurate and beneficial guidance over time.</p>
        <p>Developing this wearable sports bra was a rewarding challenge that allowed me to apply my skills in front-end development, machine learning, and user experience design. It stands as a testament to my ability to create practical and innovative solutions to real-world problems.</p>
        <p> This experience has reinforced my commitment to developing tech solutions that make a positive impact.</p>
